        <p>
          I am just a normal tennager who loves coding and building web
          applications. I am looking for a junior react web developer to start
          into the real world of web development. I have a complete
          understanding of HTML, CSS and javascript. I have also used frameworks
          such as Tailwind for CSS and react for javascript library. I am
          currently looking for an opportunity to explore my technical skills.
